# Dosadi v2

Dosadi v2 establishes a top-down omniscient systems model; all prior character-level experiments are deprecated in favour of the structured agents, wards, and playbooks documented under `docs/latest`.

# Current Objectives

Developing the Founding Wakeup MVP into a fully fleshed "Golden Age Phase" simulation, using agents which track episodes in memory, and use them to decide goals and actions.

Intention is to develop simple decision making systems for tier-1 agents, and to use tier-3 agents as decision protocol authors, after they review historical recorded episodes.
