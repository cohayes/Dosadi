# Industry and Economy of Dosadi

## Overview
Dosadi’s economy is hierarchical and closed.  
Every industry revolves around one element: **water**, the universal medium of power.  
Labor, loyalty, and maintenance all orbit this scarcity.

## Economic Principles
- **Water as Currency:** every act converts to moisture debt or credit.  
- **Energy Rationing:** heat and power are controlled by quota.  
- **Maintenance as Wealth:** tools and skills endure longer than tokens.  
- **Surveillance as Market:** all exchanges generate data for superiors.

## The Black Market
- Functions as a **shadow regulator** — too vital to destroy.  
- Trades in banned moisture units, data leaks, and unlicensed repairs.  
- Operates in tolerated illegality: officials profit indirectly.

## Economic Simulation Hooks
- **Supply Chains:** model inter-ward dependencies and bottlenecks.  
- **Corruption:** flourishes wherever authority lacks the teeth to enforce compliance.  
- **Scarcity Pressure:** shifting scarcity provokes social volatility.  
- **Repair Ecosystem:** degradation events generate demand, alliances, and betrayal.

## Future Expansion

- Faction monopolies and collapses.  
- Hidden economies (information, trust, addiction).
