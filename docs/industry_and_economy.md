# Industry and Economy of Dosadi

## Overview
Dosadi’s economy is closed, hierarchical, and resource-constrained.  
Every industry revolves around one element: **water** — the medium of life, energy, and power.  
Labor, loyalty, and maintenance all exist in service to the Well.

## Economic Principles
- **Water as Currency:** all value is expressed through moisture equivalents.  
- **Energy Rationing:** power generation and heat exchange are tightly regulated.  
- **Maintenance as Capital:** functional equipment and skilled repairers are the true stores of wealth.  
- **Surveillance as Infrastructure:** every transaction doubles as a data point for control.

## Industrial Sectors
| Sector | Function | Control |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Extraction** | Reclamation from waste, respiration, and corpse recovery. | Ward Counts / Technicians |
| **Processing** | Filtration, condensation, and purity monitoring. | Bureaucratic Guilds |
| **Manufacturing** | Suit components, filters, and circuit boards. | Industrial Barons |
| **Food Production** | Synth-meat, fungal mass, and nutrient slurry. | Biochemical Wards |
| **Maintenance / Repair** | Vital for system continuity; semi-legal economy. | Guilds & Black Markets |
| **Security** | Armament, surveillance, and enforcement. | Dukes & Military Branches |
| **Trade and Black Market** | Circulates forbidden modifications, contraband, and unregistered moisture. | Unaligned Operatives |

## The Black Market
The black market forms a **shadow economy** of efficiency and defiance:
- Trades in illegal condensation units and unregistered repairs.  
- Employs scavengers, rogue technicians, and smugglers.  
- Operates under tacit approval — its collapse would cripple the official economy.  

---

## Economic Simulation Hooks
- **Supply Chains:** simulate inter-ward dependencies (e.g., moisture → filtration → distribution).  
- **Corruption Flow:** efficiency trades off with loyalty; bribery as systemic equilibrium.  
- **Scarcity Pressure:** dynamic scarcity influences social tension and agent risk-taking.  
- **Repair Ecosystem:** degradation events drive resource flow and faction interaction.

## Future Expansion
Later phases may introduce:
- Trade networks across wards.  
- Faction-based markets and monopolies.  
- Hidden economies (information, favor, and trust as commodities).
