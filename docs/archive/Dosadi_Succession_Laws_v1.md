# **Dosadi Succession Laws v1 (Annex)**

---

## 1) Purpose

Define how **leadership transfers** after death, coup, retirement, or incapacity, and how active **contracts and obligations** persist through succession.

**Core Principle:**  
> Legitimacy is inherited only to the extent it can command obedience and deliver outcomes.

---

## 2) Legitimacy Metrics by Archetype

| Archetype | Legitimacy Basis | Secondary Modifiers |
|---|---|---|
| **Feudal (King/Dukes/Lords)** | Mandate delivery + enforcement capacity | Royal favor, rumoral standing |
| **Military/Mercenary** | Command power = troops × equipment × readiness | Campaign record, pay reliability |
| **Industrial Guild** | Technical competence × output reliability | Safety record, innovation credit |
| **Civic Commonwealth** | Service-network backing × compromise skill × law fluency | Mediation wins, audit cleanliness |
| **Cult** | Doctrinal authority × ritual control × narcotic lines | Vision charisma, miracle memes |
| **Bureaucratic/Arbiters** | Seniority × case consistency × incorruptibility | Ledger integrity, peer citations |

## 3) Procedures (Defaults & Variants)

### 3.1 Feudal Sovereigns (King/Dukes/Lords)
- **Default:** Designated heir assumes title.  
- **Hostile Transfer:** Victor’s leader assumes title; High Arbiter records continuity.  
- **Grace Window:** 1–2 cascade cycles to reaffirm mandates; failure → legitimacy loss and claimant challenges.

### 3.2 Military/Mercenary Orders
- **Default:** Highest command power officer takes lead.  
- **Contested:** Circuit Arbiter validates order of battle, pay ledgers, and muster rolls.  
- **Penalty for Fragmentation:** Broken houses lose licenses or civic protection.

### 3.3 Industrial Guilds
- **Default:** Highest-competence master confirmed by Guild Council + Arbiter witness.  
- **Safety/Quality Audit:** Mandatory; poor scores trigger co-leadership or receivership.  
- **License Roll-Over:** All active permits reissued under successor.

### 3.4 Civic Commonwealths
- **Default:** Candidate with broadest service-provider signatures.  
- **Public Caucus:** Witnessed by Civic Observers; ties broken by Arbiter mediation.  
- **Continuity Mandate:** Critical services cannot pause; temporary steward assigned if dispute persists.

### 3.5 Cults
- **Default:** Per internal canon (chosen heir, ritual trials).  
- **External Recognition:** Arbiter logs successor for inter-faction dealings only.  
- **Public Safety Clause:** If succession sparks violence, Feudal Law overrides Cult Statute.

### 3.6 Bureaucratic Networks / Arbiters
- **Default:** Seniority with integrity review.  
- **High Bench Confirmation:** High Arbiter ratifies to prevent local capture.

---

## 4) Contract Continuity

- **Persistence Rule:** Active contracts transfer to successor automatically.  
- **Grace Window:** Short period for renegotiation of deadlines without penalty.  
- **Breach on Refusal:** Outright repudiation triggers dispute; Arbiter-led restorative plan or retributive sanction.

---

## 5) Civic Record & Rumor Effects

- **Public Entry:** Succession outcome appended to Civic Record.  
- **Rumor Emission:** “New leader confirmed/contested” with credibility weighted by witness tier.  
- **Meme Formation:** Stable successions strengthen faction reliability; chaotic transfers seed coup narratives.

---

## 6) Failure Modes & Edge Cases

- **Dual Claims:** Competing successors → Arbiter arbitration; temporary escrow of critical contracts.  
- **Clerk Capture:** Falsified records → legitimacy collapse; royal audit.  
- **Silent Coup:** Black-market token contracts used to buy militias; discovery triggers retributive cascade.

---

## 7) Integration

- **Law & Contract Systems:** Automatic contract migration; dispute hooks.  
- **Governance:** Legitimacy recalculation on succession; corruption checks on ledgers.  
- **Rumor/Perception:** High-salience memory events; meme updates.  
- **Temporal Simulation:** Succession timers, grace windows, audit cycles.
