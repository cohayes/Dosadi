# Dosadi Economic Systems v1

## I. Foundational Concepts

### 1. Assets: The Three Classes of Capital

All economic life on Dosadi revolves around three interchangeable but distinct forms of wealth.

| Asset Type | Description | Example Behaviors |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Materials** | Physical goods — raw reagents, components, finished products. Obey conservation law. | Mining, refinement, recycling. |
| **Currency** | Symbolic claim on water or production, denominated in lord-specific “credits.” | Minting, exchange, speculation. |
| **Promises** | Contractual obligations — social IOUs binding production, loyalty, or service. | Mandates, levies, fealty oaths. |

Conversion among these types defines all trade. Each is governed by its own loss mechanisms:  
- Materials decay or are stolen.  
- Currency inflates or deflates.  
- Promises are broken, corrupted, or redeemed.

---

### 2. Credit Ecology

Each noble mints **credits** tied to their personal reservoir.  
Credits are redeemable for water or goods under the noble’s control.

Dosadi uses **floating, market-driven exchange rates** between lordly credits.  
Rates fluctuate according to:
- Local productivity  
- Trust/reliability of the issuing lord  
- Information stability (rumor, unrest)  

**Result:** The entire empire breathes with chaotic vitality.  
No single price or value remains constant for long; every transaction is a wager on the future.

---

### 3. The Cascading Barrel System

The king controls the Well and uses daily or periodic **barrel distributions** to manage loyalty and production.  
Each distribution creates a “cascade” down the hierarchy:

1. The King allocates water to chosen lords.  
2. Each lord divides their share among subordinate houses or guilds.  
3. At each step, a **tax of 5–15%** is extracted in credits, flowing back upward.  

**Flow directionality:**
- **Water → down** (mass distribution)  
- **Credits → up** (symbolic debt repayment)

The result is a closed, feedback-driven economy — hydraulic in both metaphor and mathematics.  
Each day’s cascade acts as the **governance algorithm** of the planet.

---

### 4. Taxation and Oversight

Every transaction of water or reclaimed resource triggers taxation:
- Local lords collect levies from guilds and vassals.
- The king’s observers (clerks, auditors, informants) track volumes and ensure the proper flow of credit taxes upward.

These auditors form a powerful bureaucratic guild of their own, balancing data integrity, loyalty, and subtle manipulation.  
Their records provide the “state awareness” that powers the king’s macroeconomic decisions.

---

### 5. Promise Markets

Promises (production mandates, fealty oaths, service contracts) are **tradable instruments** — effectively **feudal bonds** whose value depends on the issuer’s reliability.

Each entity has a **Reliability Index:**
R_i = Promises Fulfilled / Promises Issued

- High reliability strengthens both the issuer’s credits and their political legitimacy.  
- Defaulted promises generate reputational contagion — rumors of betrayal that can devalue even loyal neighbors.

Thus, trust becomes quantifiable and tradeable — **a fourth invisible currency** permeating the economy.

---

### 6. The Reclamation Guild — Death as Liquidity

Originally a neutral utility, the Reclamation Guild now serves as Dosadi’s **shadow bank.**

They issue **Grey Notes**, credits backed by reclaimed water and biomass.  
These circulate alongside official currencies but are subject to dual taxation:
- **10% to local lord**, for ward legitimacy.  
- **5% to the king**, to preserve royal oversight.

Their economic role:  
- Provide liquidity during crises.  
- Convert societal decay into new capital.  
- Serve as entropy indicators — their profits rise with suffering.

They represent the *moral inversion* of Dosadi’s economy: prosperity through efficient death.

## II. Macroeconomic Behavior

### 1. Market Dynamics

The floating credit system ensures perpetual fluctuation:
R_ij(t+1) = R_ij(t) + ψ(ΔP_i, ΔT_i, ΔI_i)

Where:
- P_i: production performance  
- T_i: trust/reliability  
- I_i: information stability  

Exchange volatility becomes the daily measure of political health — a living metric of who the king’s true allies and risks are.

---

### 2. King’s Control Function

The king’s distribution of barrels acts as a **hydraulic feedback controller:**
W_i(t+1) = W_i(t) + φ_i(S_i, L_i, P_i)

where:
- S_i: social stability  
- L_i: loyalty  
- P_i: productive potential  

He aims to minimize instability variance across all wards, ensuring no region remains in rebellion long enough to develop autonomy.

---

### 3. Dual Signaling Meritocracy

Dosadi’s economy blends **symbolic loyalty** and **actual competence:**
Reward_i = f(S_public, P_private)

- *Public signal:* ritual obedience earns favor.  
- *Private signal:* genuine innovation and productivity secure long-term reward.  

This dual system drives paranoia, competition, and adaptation — a self-sharpening meritocracy where pretense and performance coexist.

---

## III. Systemic Failure and Renewal

All major economic crises on Dosadi arise from **trust asymmetries** — when the perception of value diverges from physical or informational reality.  
There are three canonical forms:

---

### 1. Inflation — “The Drowning of the Dry”

**Trigger:** Over-issuance of credits and promises beyond real water reserves.  
**Psychology:** *Greedy confidence* — everyone believes wealth will keep growing.  
**Symptoms:**  
- Credits lose purchasing power.  
- Prices rise rapidly; real goods vanish.  
- Black markets thrive; faith in currency erodes.  
**Resolution:**  
- Forced audits or credit burns (“Cleansing of Tokens”).  
- Water redistributions to reset value baseline.  
- Often ends in famine or riot — the flood recedes, leaving rot.

---

### 2. Hoarding — “The Thirst of Plenty”

**Trigger:** Widespread belief that labor or trade won’t be rewarded fairly.  
**Psychology:** *Fear-induced apathy* — despair replaces faith in the system.  
**Symptoms:**  
- Economic velocity collapses; trade halts.  
- Goods exist but circulation stops.  
- Asking prices soar as each transaction is seen as a risk.  
- Production mandates stall; social trust withers.  
**Resolution:**  
- Forced redistribution or credit expiration decrees.  
- Manufactured crises to reignite circulation.  
- Cultural scars: each event leaves society colder, more cynical.  
**Philosophy:**  
The only drought worse than scarcity is one made by the mind — when even abundance inspires fear.

---

### 3. Data Fraud — “The False Cascade”

**Trigger:** Corruption in the king’s information network.  
**Psychology:** *Strategic deception* — clerks falsify data to survive or profit.  
**Symptoms:**  
- Misallocation of water and credits.  
- Loyal wards punished, rebels rewarded.  
- Rumors of royal incompetence or treachery spread.  
**Resolution:**  
- Purges and recalibrations (“The Still Days”).  
- Temporary centralization of control.  
- Emergence of secondary surveillance guilds, multiplying paranoia.  
**Philosophy:**  
When data itself lies, truth becomes a weapon — and the Well becomes blind.

### 4. The Hydraulic Cycle of Collapse

| Phase | Driver | Outcome |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Inflation** | Greed and overconfidence | Token devaluation |
| **Hoarding** | Fear and despair | Trade paralysis |
| **Data Fraud** | Deception and survivalism | System blindness |
| **Purge** | Reforms, executions, redistribution | Temporary renewal |

This rhythmic cycle — expansion, stagnation, corruption, cleansing — is the heartbeat of Dosadi’s economy.  
It ensures that entropy never disappears; it merely *changes form.*

---

## IV. Cultural Consequences

- **Cynicism as Rationality:**  
  Citizens learn that belief is costly. Cynicism becomes the rational default, faith a luxury.  

- **Moral Fluidity:**  
  Efficiency, not honesty, defines virtue. Even corruption can serve stability if it preserves flow.  

- **Economic Religion:**  
  Every transaction is a moral act; every barrel a sermon on survival.
