# **Dosadi Rumor Stress Scenarios v1**

---

## **1. Purpose and Philosophy**

Rumor stress events are *information crises* — moments when the social and perceptual systems of Dosadi become overloaded.  
They demonstrate how misinformation, fear, and ambition can destabilize even a rigidly stratified world.

Every stress event follows the same pattern:
1. **Trigger:** A material or social event sparks the creation of rumors.
2. **Propagation:** Rumors cascade through communication networks.
3. **Feedback:** Agents, factions, and lords react based on perceived truth.
4. **Consequence:** Governance, economy, and environment adjust in response.

**Core Principle:**  
> On Dosadi, truth is not stable — it is the oscillation between panic and control.

## **2. General Framework**

Each rumor cascade can be mapped as a four-phase process:

| Phase | Description | Temporal Duration |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Ignition** | Trigger event spawns rumors. Local networks amplify initial claims. | 1–2 cycles |
| **Spread** | Rumors propagate through trade, smuggler, and factional lines. | 2–10 cycles |
| **Crisis** | Panic, opportunism, and violence emerge as factions act. | 5–20 cycles |
| **Resolution** | Truth clarifies or is overwritten by new narratives. | 10+ cycles |

### Common Variables:
- **Rumor Density:** Number of active rumors per ward.
- **Legitimacy Drift:** How quickly the public’s trust in authority shifts.
- **Social Entropy:** Collective confusion; when it peaks, order decays.
- **Recovery Factor:** Efficiency of rumor suppression or absorption into new myths.

## **3. Scenario Archetypes**

### **3.1 Famine Rumor Surge**
Minor disruption in water shipments → rumors of systemic drought. Merchants spread warnings, panic follows, shortages become real. After royal redistribution, famine becomes legend: *“The Day of Empty Cups.”*

### **3.2 Rebellion Spark**
Rumor of a lord’s assassination spreads. Legitimacy collapses before proof arrives. Even if the lord survives, the wound to loyalty remains for an epoch.

### **3.3 Mystic Bloom**
Narcotic visions align — “The Well bleeds red.” The rumor infects the faithful and fearful alike, birthing a cult or a purge. Myth endures either way.

### **3.4 Economic Cascade**
Counterfeit credits erode faith in all trade. Transactions freeze; corruption spikes. Recovery demands new minting protocols and propaganda campaigns.

### **3.5 Well Contamination Panic**
Discolored water shipment sparks panic. Hydration drops, deaths rise, cults proclaim judgment. Truth arrives too late — executions follow, trust shattered.

## **4. Cross-Scenario System Behavior**

| System Element | Stress Response | Recovery Mechanism |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Legitimacy** | Sharp decline during rumor surges. | Rebuilt through punishment or myth. |
| **Corruption** | Spikes as self-interest dominates. | Drops as order returns. |
| **Loyalty** | Polarizes between strong and weak factions. | Realignment or coup. |
| **Information Load** | Merges into myth when oversaturated. | Rumor decay and suppression. |
| **Entropy Index** | Climbs rapidly, then stabilizes post-crisis. | Social reclamation and propaganda. |

---

## **5. Recovery Patterns**

1. **Suppression:** Forceful purges — quick control, lasting fear.  
2. **Absorption:** Co-opted into official narrative — slower, enduring myth.  
3. **Replacement:** Overwritten by new crisis — unstable equilibrium.

---

## **6. Future Hooks**

- Quantitative rumor density and decay modeling.  
- Agent learning for rumor resistance or exploitation.  
- Integration with narrative arcs as major historical events.  
- Persistence of myths across eras.
