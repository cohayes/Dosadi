# Development Plan – Project Dosadi

## Objective
Create a modular, simulation-driven environment inspired by *The Dosadi Experiment*.  
The project bridges narrative worldbuilding with reinforcement learning and real-time strategy mechanics.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation
**Goal:** Establish a working simulation loop with agent-environment interactions.

- Implement `Environment`, `Agent`, and `Simulation` scaffolds.
- Define agent attributes (needs, stress, loyalty, perception).
- Create the soup kitchen prototype — first controlled micro-environment.
- Build `/docs` as worldbuilding reference.
- Integrate lightweight logging and data export for analysis.

---

## Phase 2 — Reinforcement Learning Integration
**Goal:** Train decision policies for agents under partial information.

- Use Gymnasium-compatible environment wrappers.
- Implement reward functions tied to survival and satisfaction.
- Experiment with Q-learning and policy gradients.
- Model exploration vs exploitation tradeoffs.
- Evaluate emergent coordination (queueing, theft, cooperation).

---

## Phase 3 — Social Systems & Governance
**Goal:** Add factional structure, surveillance, and corruption.

- Implement registries, quotas, and audits.
- Track factional loyalty, compliance, and reputation.
- Enable black-market systems for trade and modification.
- Introduce stochastic “law enforcement” events.

---

## Phase 4 — Multi-Ward Simulation
**Goal:** Scale up simulation architecture.

- Create multiple environment zones (wards) with unique economic profiles.
- Implement travel and information latency between zones.
- Develop event-driven inter-ward dependencies (supply shortages, contamination).
- Optimize agent simulation with async or batch processing.

---

## Phase 5 — Persistent World
**Goal:** Transition from single-player simulation to long-term multiplayer world.

- Create server-side simulation layers and persistent data.
- Support asynchronous multiplayer or cooperative sessions.
- Integrate community-driven events or AI-controlled “Overseers.”

---

## Supporting Infrastructure
- **Version Control:** GitHub repository (`cohayes/Dosadi`)  
- **Documentation:** `/docs` folder for conceptual and design data.  
- **Collaboration:** ChatGPT for conceptual design, Codex for code development.  
- **Analysis:** Local notebooks for RL experiments and metrics tracking.

---

## Long-Term Vision
Dosadi becomes a **self-sustaining world of systems**, where scarcity breeds ingenuity and identity is shaped by survival.  
Each player, agent, and algorithm co-authors a civilization evolving at the edge of extinction.
