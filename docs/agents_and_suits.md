# Agents and Environmental Suits

## Overview
Agents are autonomous actors within the Dosadi simulation.  
Each agent has physical, psychological, and social states that evolve through experience and environment.  
The goal is not scripted behavior, but **emergent motivation** — survival, ambition, and adaptation under scarcity.

## Core Attributes
- **Physical Needs:** hunger, thirst, fatigue, temperature regulation.  
- **Psychological State:** stress, fear, ambition, loyalty, and suspicion.  
- **Social Variables:** reputation, faction alignment, and perceived status.  
- **Inventory:** items (credits, tools, suit condition, black-market mods).  
- **Perception Noise:** agents perceive incomplete or distorted states from the environment and other agents.

## Agent Archetypes
| Archetype | Description | Behavior Focus |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Staff** | Workers maintaining kitchens, checkpoints, or facilities. | Balance compliance with survival pragmatism. |
| **Patrons** | Civilians seeking food, shelter, or access. | Queue navigation, risk assessment, social bargaining. |
| **Security** | Enforcers maintaining order and surveillance. | Monitor and intervene; assess threats vs authority. |
| **Black-Market Operatives** | Traders, smugglers, or hackers. | Navigate between factions, exploit systemic blind spots. |
| **Auditors** | Bureaucrats ensuring compliance with ward quotas. | Observe patterns, detect anomalies, manipulate data. |
| **Assassins / Agents of Change** | Rare covert actors with directed objectives. | Operate under hidden motives; exploit perception systems. |

## Environmental Suits
Survival depends on capturing and retaining bodily moisture.

| Tier | Wearer Class | Description |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Elite Suits** | Nobility, researchers | Full moisture recovery, integrated respirators, AI diagnostics, luxury fit. |
| **Industrial Suits** | Engineers, laborers | Robust filtration, partial moisture reclaim, heavy joint plating. |
| **Civic Suits** | Middle-class, clerks | Efficient air filters, moderate reclamation, designed for long shifts. |
| **Scavenger Suits** | Lower class | Reused or improvised components, patchwork seal integrity. |
| **Black-Market Mods** | All classes | Unauthorized augmentations; risk of malfunction, infection, or detection. |
| **Exo-Suits** | Military/industrial | Mechanically powered frames for heavy work or combat; high maintenance demand. |

## Maintenance Culture
Suits degrade over time — every interaction, leak, and repair is a potential economic event.  
Maintenance defines social status as much as wealth: a well-kept suit signals competence, access, and respect.  
Black-market repairers form an invisible economy of patchers and salvagers who keep the city breathing.

## Future Implementation
In simulation:
- Suit condition affects agent stamina and thirst rate.  
- Maintenance and repair events generate economic and social links.  
- Agents trade efficiency for stealth or comfort (mods, damage, and corruption).
