# Project Dosadi — Overview

## Synopsis
Dosadi is a resource-scarce world where a hyper-competitive and adaptive society has formed around the planet’s single clean water source.  
Ethics are fluid; every interaction is a currency exchange — of material, loyalty, or information.  
Loyalty itself is a wager on the future: citizens constantly align with the most promising faction of tomorrow, hedging for survival when today’s order inevitably collapses.

## Concept
Dosadi is a simulation of survival, control, and adaptation on a planet engineered for scarcity.  
The world exists as a closed social experiment: an ecosystem where human life continues only by mastery of resource cycles and social manipulation.  

Players experience this through a **pause-able real-time strategy / role-playing hybrid** that mixes exploration, scarcity management, and interpersonal tension.  
Initially single-player, the long-term goal is to scale to a persistent, massively multiplayer simulation of an evolving world.

## Design Goals
- **Emergent Complexity:** No single “win” condition. Systems of scarcity, trust, and control generate spontaneous drama.  
- **Embodied Intelligence:** Every agent has perception, intention, and memory — behavior emerges from survival logic.  
- **Perception Uncertainty:** Agents see a noisy, partial world and act from inference.  
- **Socioeconomic Hierarchies:** Access to moisture, power, and knowledge defines class boundaries.  
- **Maintenance Culture:** Technology decays; repair and improvisation are currency.

## Development Trajectory
1. **Prototype Era** – Single-player soup-kitchen scenario with agents interacting under resource scarcity.  
2. **Expansion Era** – Ward-level simulation with trade, governance, and surveillance systems.  
3. **Persistence Era** – Large-scale, real-time simulation with asynchronous or cooperative multiplayer.

## Core Loop
1. Observe → Perceive → Decide → Act → Consequence.  
2. Agents and environment evolve continuously; player choices ripple through systems.  
3. Every breath, favor, and betrayal is part of the same economy of scarcity.
