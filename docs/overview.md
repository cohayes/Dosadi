# Project Dosadi — Overview

## Concept
Dosadi is a simulation of survival, control, and adaptation on a planet engineered for scarcity.  
The world exists as a closed social experiment: an ecosystem where human life continues only by mastery of resource cycles and social manipulation.  

Players experience this through a **pause-able real-time strategy / role-playing hybrid** that mixes exploration, scarcity management, and interpersonal tension.  
Initially single-player, the long-term goal is to scale to a persistent, massively multiplayer simulation of an evolving world.

## Design Goals
- **Emergent Complexity:** No single “win” condition. Systems of scarcity, trust, and control generate spontaneous drama.  
- **Embodied Intelligence:** Every agent has perception, intention, and memory — their behavior is driven by individual survival logic.  
- **Perception Uncertainty:** Agents see a noisy, partial world. Decisions are based on incomplete information and social inference.  
- **Socioeconomic Hierarchies:** Access to moisture, power, and knowledge define class boundaries.  
- **Maintenance Culture:** Technology, like people, decays. Repair and improvisation are as valuable as creation.

## Development Trajectory
1. **Prototype Era** – Single-player “soup kitchen” scenario with agents interacting under resource scarcity.  
2. **Expansion Era** – Ward-level simulation with trade, governance, and surveillance systems.  
3. **Persistence Era** – Real-time, large-scale simulation with asynchronous or cooperative multiplayer elements.

## Thematic Touchstones
- Frank Herbert’s *The Dosadi Experiment* (moral stress, engineered societies).  
- Orwell’s *1984* (surveillance and bureaucratic manipulation).  
- SimCity, RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress (emergent social dynamics).  
- Frostpunk (resource ethics and survival tradeoffs).

## Core Loop
1. Observe → Perceive → Decide → Act → Consequence.  
2. Agents and environment evolve continuously; player choices ripple through systems.  
3. Every life, machine, and molecule is part of the same economy of scarcity.
