# Governance and Law on Dosadi

## Overview
Power on Dosadi is bureaucratic, layered, and self-reinforcing.  
Law exists not for justice but for **control through compliance**.  
Survival is legal only when it is registered.

## Structure of Authority
| Tier | Domain | Description |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **King / Overseer** | Planetary | Symbolic apex; maintains illusion of order. |
| **Dukes** | Regional | Manage industries and enforce quotas. |
| **Counts** | Ward-Level | Administer labor, surveillance, and resources. |
| **Barons, Bishops, Mayors** | Institutional | Oversee military, social, and industrial organization respectively. |

## Law as System Control
- **Registration:** every person, tool, and breath is logged.  
- **Auditing:** random loyalty checks ensure hierarchy integrity.  
- **Compliance Incentives:** rewards in rations or privileges reinforce obedience.  
- **Punitive Measures:** unregistered repair, speech, or hoarding result in deprivation or exile.

## Bureaucracy and Corruption
- **Might makes right** — the powerful act freely so long as they maintain control.  
- Corruption is not deviance but stability; favors keep systems fluid.  
- **Tarnishing one’s image** in the eyes of superiors is a bureaucrat’s greatest fear — reputation equals survival.

## Cultural Impact
- Obedience is pragmatic, not moral.  
- Power is a prediction market: citizens bet their loyalty on the next victor.  
- **Access to higher echelons** of any faction requires visible, often brutal, tests of loyalty.  
- **Belief in tomorrow’s victor** shapes behavior and identity — adaptability is the only lasting virtue.

## Simulation Relevance
- Law provides environmental constraints on behavior (e.g., patrols, audits).  
- Fear and loyalty metrics regulate agent interaction.  
- Corruption defines the difference between stable and collapsing systems.
