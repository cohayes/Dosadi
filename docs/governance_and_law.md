# Governance and Law on Dosadi

## Overview
Power on Dosadi is bureaucratic, layered, and self-reinforcing.  
Law is less about justice and more about **control through compliance**.  
Survival is legal only when it is registered.

## Structure of Authority
| Tier | Domain | Description |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **King / Overseer** | Planetary | The symbolic apex; maintains the illusion of centralized control. |
| **Dukes** | Regional | Manage macro-industries and enforce quotas. |
| **Counts** | Ward-Level | Administer water, labor, and surveillance within their districts. |
| **Barons & Bishops** | Institutional | Operate key facilities (medical, food, or technical). |
| **Mayors** | Local | Handle daily resource distribution and crowd control. |

## Law as System Control
- **Registration:** every person, tool, and breath is logged into central accounting.  
- **Auditing:** random loyalty tests ensure obedience.  
- **Compliance Incentives:** privileges like cooling time or extra moisture are granted for cooperation.  
- **Punitive Measures:** misallocation, unregistered repair, or unsanctioned speech results in ration penalties or exile.

## Bureaucracy and Corruption
- Officials justify corruption as efficiency — “better that someone competent breaks the rules.”  
- Access to data is power: auditors can alter metrics to favor allies or suppress rivals.  
- Surveillance is both **instrument and addiction** — bureaucrats fear losing visibility as much as losing status.

## Cultural Impact
- Obedience is a survival mechanism, not a virtue.  
- Trust networks form within layers of mutual extortion.  
- “Loyalty tests” are ritualized — citizens publicly denounce others to demonstrate purity.  
- Law shapes identity: one is defined by registration, not belief.

## Simulation Relevance
- Legal systems provide behavioral constraints for agents (e.g., patrols, inspections).  
- Corruption acts as both a lubricant and instability factor in the economy.  
- Loyalty, compliance, and fear become quantifiable social states.
