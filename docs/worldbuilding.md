# Dosadi — Worldbuilding Document

## Planetary Environment
- A **single well** supplies the only clean water.  
- **No rainfall**; the air is arid and chemically stable.  
- The planet experiences **mild wind and temperature cycles** from day-night heating — occasional dust storms exist but are secondary to the political narrative.  
- **Respiration and sweat** are reclaimed by moisture suits; every breath is part of the economy.  
- **Dehumidifiers** are valuable home technology and a status symbol.

---

## Ecology
- Natural biology is nearly extinct.  
- Microflora persist only in sealed ecosystems and maintenance tanks.  
- **Everything of value is under surveillance** — scavengers themselves are disposable, but the relics or data they carry are not.

---

## Society and Hierarchy
- **Elites (King, Dukes, Counts):** control the Well and industry.  
- **Middle Classes:** bureaucrats, technicians, and military overseers maintaining order and quotas.  
- **Working Poor:** scavengers and industrial laborers living on recycled suits and hand-me-down tech.  
- **Outcasts:** unregistered citizens and smugglers trading in forbidden maintenance.

---

## Culture
- Pragmatism is the closest thing to morality.  
- **Sentimentality is a luxury few can afford.**  
- **Sharing space and vulnerability** occurs only among those with aligned interests.  
- **Narcotics** are pervasive — as leisure, stimulant, and instrument of loyalty; addiction doubles as social control.  

---

## Architecture and Infrastructure
- Architecture reflects caste: structures are designed to **capture and reuse the humidity and radiant vapor** of their inhabitants.  
- **Public spaces** are dense and closely **regulated**; private ones are granted by status.  
- Maintenance guilds and auditor factions enforce compliance through quotas and social metrics.

## The Well
The Well holds a **finite but undisclosed** reserve of water — its true capacity is known only to a few elite engineers.  
Its origin lies with the original colonists, and its mechanisms are shrouded in secrecy.  
The elite guild maintaining it guards both its history and the illusion of perpetuity.  
To control the Well is to control life itself — and the fear of its depletion binds society together.
