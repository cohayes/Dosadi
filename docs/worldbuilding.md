# Dosadi — Worldbuilding Document

## Planetary Environment
- A **single well** is the world’s central water source.  
- **No rainfall**; the air is hyper-dry and thin.  
- **Respiration and sweat** are reclaimed by moisture suits; every breath is part of the economy.  
- **Dehumidifiers** are common household technology and a major wealth symbol.  
- **No wind, no storms** — air is chemically stabilized; decay and dust are artificially suppressed.

## Ecology
- Natural biology is nearly extinct.  
- Microflora survive in engineered reservoirs or sealed ecosystems.  
- Everything alive is under surveillance — tagged, recycled, or controlled by ward bureaucracies.

---

## Society and Hierarchy
- **Elites (King, Dukes, Counts):** command water allocation, control industrial technology. Rarely exposed to the atmosphere.  
- **Middle Classes:** technical, bureaucratic, and military roles. Maintain surveillance networks and system infrastructure.  
- **Working Poor:** scavengers, repairers, and industrial workers who depend on recycled suits and hand-me-down tech.  
- **Outcasts:** black-market engineers, smugglers, or unregistered residents who operate outside official water accounting.

## Culture
- Pragmatism replaces religion: efficiency, loyalty, and adaptability are moral virtues.  
- Speech and gesture are subdued — every movement conserves moisture and energy.  
- Music, scent, and taste are luxuries reserved for elites or sacred ceremonies.  
- Breathing together is an intimate act — shared air signifies trust or dominance.

## Architecture and Infrastructure
- Cities are divided into **36 wards**, each optimized for an industry or social function.  
- Every ward is a microclimate with regulated humidity and filtration quotas.  
- **Maintenance guilds** and **auditor factions** ensure compliance; corruption is endemic but pragmatic.  
- Public spaces are dense, humid, and closely monitored. Private ones are rare.

## The Well
At the center of civilization stands the Well — a vast, ancient reclamation system that recycles every molecule of water used on Dosadi.  
The Well is both **technological and mythic**:  
- Technological: maintained by engineers, purified by algorithms.  
- Mythic: seen as the “lungs” of Dosadi — the boundary between life and vacuum.  
To control the Well is to control life itself.
