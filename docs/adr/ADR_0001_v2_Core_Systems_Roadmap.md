# Dosadi v2 Core Systems
### (Hydraulic Power, Credit Ecology, and Social Entropy)
**Author:** Conner Hayes  
**Version:** 2.0 — Post-Reformation Canon  
**Purpose:** Defines the current, authoritative framework of the Dosadi world economy, hierarchy, and simulation logic.  
**Supersedes:** All pre-Reformation design documents (pipe network, mono-industry wards, etc.)

---

## 1. Overview

Dosadi is a closed ecological and political system structured around **control of water** as the primary determinant of power.  
The city-world is divided into **36 walled wards**, each ruled by a **lord or noble**, who in turn serve as vassals—directly or indirectly—to the **King of the Well**.  

Barrels of water drawn from the Well constitute the physical and symbolic lifeblood of civilization.  
Every element of Dosadi’s social, economic, and moral architecture is an extension of this **hydraulic hierarchy**: whoever controls water, controls life.

---

## 2. Hydraulic Economy: Water and Credits

### 2.1. Credit Structure
- Currency exists as **credits**, electronically verifiable and nearly impossible to forge.  
- Each noble mints credits bearing their own likeness (e.g., *King-Credit*, *Duke1-Credit*, *Count3-Credit*).  
- A credit represents a **redeemable claim** on that noble’s water reservoir at an exchange rate determined by the issuer’s treasurer.  
- Lords pay their retainers, soldiers, and citizens in their own credits, creating overlapping regional economies.

### 2.2. Reservoir and Container Efficiencies
- **King and elite reservoirs:** 100% retention.  
- **High-caste reservoirs:** 99.99% per day.  
- **Mid-caste reservoirs:** 99% per day.  
- **Low-caste reservoirs:** 95% per day (variable by maintenance and material).  
- Containers (barrels, flasks, rations) mirror these efficiencies according to their quality of manufacture.

### 2.3. Distribution and Consumption
- Water is raised from the Well by a priestly guild of technicians and enters the King’s reservoir at perfect efficiency.  
- Sealed containers ensure no loss in inter-ward transfer.  
- Food preparation, bodily use, and reclamation each introduce efficiency loss proportional to the **quality of manufacture and environment**.  
- Higher quality = lower entropy.  
- Each individual’s suit acts as a personal retention system:
  - **Elite suits:** 99.9% bodily water preservation.  
  - **Mid-tier:** 95–99%.  
  - **Low-tier:** 60–90%.

### 2.4. Credit Confidence and Market Flow
- Credits fluctuate in value based on **public confidence** in the issuer’s stability and reservoir purity.  
- Smugglers engage in **currency arbitrage**, trafficking credits between wards to exploit exchange rate disparities.  
- Lords can over-issue credits, generating **hydraulic debt**—claims on water they no longer physically possess.

## 3. Reclamation Guild System

### 3.1. Structure and Legitimacy
- The **Reclamation Guild** is a royal monopoly derived from the King’s engineering corps.  
- Its agents operate across all wards under the protection of noble law.  
- They are designated as **non-targets**—attacks on reclaimers provoke universal retaliation.

### 3.2. Function
- Converts biomass, corpses, and greywater into potable water and reusable biofuel.  
- Efficiency is among the highest of any process on Dosadi.  
- Only the Reclamation Guild can certify **“Clean Water”** suitable for noble or export-grade use.

### 3.3. Social Role
- Reclaimers are taboo figures: necessary yet feared.  
- Excessive dealings with them invite suspicion of moral and political decay.  
- Despite their stigma, the Reclamation Guild is the **silent backbone of planetary continuity**—turning death back into life.

## 4. Information and Rumor Ecology

### 4.1. Smuggler Networks
- Operate beyond lordly control, trading **credits, weapons, narcotics, materials, and intelligence** across wards.  
- Each network node has an associated **detection risk** proportional to traffic volume.  
- Safe in anti-lord territories, dangerous within loyalist jurisdictions.

### 4.2. Narcotic Mystics
- Cult-like factions that bind followers through hallucinogenic rituals and psychological dependency.  
- Their influence provides a **cheap substitute for political control**, enforcing compliance through belief.  
- Alignment with or opposition to a local lord depends on mutual tolerance and opportunity.

### 4.3. Information Dynamics
- The city’s rumor landscape functions like **atmospheric moisture**:
  - *Safe zones* condense accurate information.  
  - *Unsafe zones* distort or erase it.  
- Mystics and smugglers form rival **information ecologies**, each shaping perception, loyalty, and paranoia.

## 5. Energy Infrastructure

### 5.1. Power Sources
- **Biofuel:** ubiquitous, derived from reclamation byproducts.  
- **Solar:** mid-tier, dependent on ward stability and capital investment.  
- **Geothermal:** elite resource, tied to upper wards near the Well.  
- **Nuclear:** rare and jealously guarded; ultimate deterrent.

### 5.2. Vulnerabilities
Each energy form introduces distinct systemic risks:  
| Source | Primary Failure Mode | Socio-Political Consequence |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Biofuel | Supply shocks | Food-water-energy tension |
| Solar | Theft, vandalism | Class resentment, power cuts |
| Geothermal | Territorial dependency | Military conflict |
| Nuclear | Meltdown/sabotage | Global crisis event |

---

## 6. Temporal Mechanics: The Hydraulic Cycle

- Time advances in **daily extraction ticks** (“Hydraulic Cycles”).  
- Each tick proceeds as:  
  1. Water extraction at the Well.  
  2. Reservoir and credit updates.  
  3. Contract and barrel distribution cascade.  
  4. Loss calculations and reclamation.  
  5. Rumor and smuggler network updates.  

- Weekly or monthly cycles allow **redistribution**, **re-negotiation of contracts**, and **caste mobility** within wards.

---

## 7. Simulation Perspective

### 7.1. Observer Mode
- Initial simulations adopt an **omniscient observer** perspective to verify world logic, resource stability, and emergent behaviors.  
- Later iterations will enable **progressive descent**—zooming from global to individual viewpoints (King → Lord → Guildmaster → Citizen → Worker).  

### 7.2. Core Simulation Layers
| Layer | Function | Examples |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Hydraulic | Resource generation, storage, loss | Water accounting |
| Economic | Credit exchange, labor contracts | Noble debts, markets |
| Social | Caste mobility, narcotic influence | Mystics, guild reputation |
| Informational | Rumor flow, espionage | Smuggler networks |
| Industrial | Energy and manufacturing | Biofuel plants, suit workshops |
| Temporal | Cycle synchronization | Daily/weekly ticks |

## 8. Key Axioms and Core Equations

1. **Axiom of Survival:**  
   *Power is survival; survival is control over what others need to live.*

2. **Axiom of Belief:**  
   *To believe you are free is more important than being free.*

3. **Axiom of Entropy:**  
   *All loss feeds reclamation; all reclamation feeds control.*

**Representative Equation (example for ward water balance):**
\[
W_{t+1} = (W_t \cdot R) + I - L + Q
\]
Where:  
- \(W_t\) = water at current tick  
- \(R\) = retention efficiency  
- \(I\) = inflow from trade/contracts  
- \(L\) = loss (entropy, theft, decay)  
- \(Q\) = reclaimed water return  

This expression underpins Dosadi’s conservation logic and connects directly to simulation parameters.
