# Ethics and Behavioral Economics – Dosadi

## Overview
On Dosadi, morality is a matter of calculation.  
Every decision — cooperation, betrayal, violence, or compassion — is an exchange of value within a network of scarcity.  
Ethics are not absolute but adaptive; survival requires constant recalibration of loyalty and self-interest.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Loyalty as Investment** | Allegiance is a wager on the stability and profitability of a faction. |
| **Efficiency as Virtue** | Actions that minimize waste and risk are culturally moral. |
| **Control as Legitimacy** | Authority is justified by effectiveness, not fairness. |
| **Adaptability as Survival** | Ethics that fail to evolve are liabilities. |
| **Information as Moral Weight** | Knowing and concealing truth carry moral significance. |

## Behavioral Drivers

| Driver | Function | Simulation Variable |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Fear** | Reduces exploration; increases conformity and obedience. | `fear_level` |
| **Ambition** | Increases risk tolerance; drives betrayal and innovation. | `ambition_level` |
| **Loyalty** | Delays opportunism; modulates trust in social contracts. | `loyalty` |
| **Stress** | Narrows decision space; amplifies bias and error. | `stress` |
| **Addiction** | Creates predictable dependency; manipulable through narcotics. | `addiction_state` |

Agents balance these competing forces through reinforcement learning or heuristic policy evaluation.

## Decision Theory Under Scarcity
Agents implicitly compute **expected survival value (ESV):**
ESV = (Short-Term Gain × Urgency) + (Long-Term Security × Loyalty Weight) - (Risk × Fear)

Each variable shifts dynamically based on stress, faction strength, and resource availability.

## Social Exchange Model
Interactions are transactional:
- **Cooperation:** increases short-term efficiency, decreases personal freedom.  
- **Betrayal:** increases personal resources, decreases social capital.  
- **Charity:** treated as reputation investment.  
- **Obedience:** short-term safety, long-term stagnation.  

Every social decision is a miniature economy balancing trust and scarcity.

## Moral Drift
Over time, environmental hardship and social volatility erode moral consistency:
- Prolonged scarcity → utilitarian behavior.  
- Stable abundance → ritualized compassion.  
- Rapid power shifts → opportunism and paranoia.  

This moral drift is measurable through changes in agent policies and faction behavior.

---

## Simulation Relevance
- **Agent Policy Biases:** encoded as weight vectors for loyalty vs ambition vs fear.  
- **Factional Morality:** emergent property from aggregate agent interactions.  
- **Ethical Events:** scenarios where policy trade-offs reveal systemic tensions (e.g., ration theft vs child survival).

## Philosophical Summary
Dosadi’s morality is fluid — not because its people are cruel, but because cruelty is efficient.  
Ethics are survival equations written in the language of scarcity.
