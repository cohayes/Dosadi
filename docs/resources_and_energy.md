# Resources and Energy – Dosadi

## Overview
Dosadi operates under a closed thermodynamic and economic model.  
Everything valuable — water, heat, information, and repair capacity — circulates through controlled loops.  
The illusion of abundance is maintained by bureaucracy; the reality is attrition.

## Primary Resources

| Resource | Description | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Water (Moisture Credits)** | Basis of all currency and sustenance. | Quantized into rations measured in micro-liters or “drops.” |
| **Energy (Thermal Units)** | Power required for life support, manufacturing, and weaponry. | Derived from decaying fusion cores and heat exchangers; heavily taxed. |
| **Materials** | Structural matter (metal, composites, organics). | Recycled indefinitely through guild systems. |
| **Information** | Data, secrets, and predictive models. | Non-material currency; traded among bureaucrats and spies. |
| **Labor** | Time, attention, and skill. | Measured in work quotas; used to repay ration debt. |
| **Faith / Loyalty** | Abstract resource measuring long-term alignment. | Quantifiable through social modeling; converts to safety or privilege. |

## Conservation and Decay

1. **Closed Loops:**  
   - All water and material resources are finite; nothing leaves the system.  
   - Losses occur through inefficiency, theft, or entropy.  
2. **Decay:**  
   - Equipment degrades over time; maintenance costs scale exponentially.  
   - Energy loss manifests as heat waste, increasing cooling burden.  
3. **Reclamation:**  
   - Recycling is near total, but socially stratified — higher castes reclaim more effectively.

## Flow Model

[Extraction] → [Processing] → [Distribution] → [Use] → [Waste] → [Reclamation] → [Extraction...]
- **Control Points:** Each stage introduces corruption and loss.  
- **Black Markets:** Create parallel flows bypassing official quotas.  
- **Guilds:** Enforce repair and filtration standards; their collapse would end civilization.

## Energy Economy
- Power allocation determines social priority: hospitals, military, and data centers receive first draw.  
- Overuse triggers rolling brownouts — environmental stress cascades into social unrest.  
- Factional sabotage (energy theft or redirection) is a common act of rebellion.

## Maintenance as Energy Sink
Every machine, from respirators to exo-suits, leaks efficiency over time.  
Maintenance requires:
- **Labor (hours)**  
- **Materials (spare parts)**  
- **Energy (power for repair tools)**  
- **Authorization (legal or black-market permits)**  

Neglect leads to breakdowns, creating both economic pressure and narrative tension.

## Simulation Implementation Notes
- **Resource Variables:**  
  - `water_total`, `energy_total`, `waste_total`  
  - `efficiency_modifiers` per ward or faction  
- **Agent Needs:**  
  - `water_rate`, `energy_cost`, `maintenance_state`  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - Scarcity → Stress → Risk Behavior → System Instability.  
- **Events:**  
  - “Heatwave,” “Filter Failure,” or “Energy Ration Cut” dynamically modify availability.

## Philosophical Frame
Energy is order; decay is truth.  
Dosadi survives only by delaying equilibrium — every action is entropy management disguised as politics.
